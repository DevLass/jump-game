This was perhaps the most complex project I've ever done, even though it's basic, it took a huge amount of work. I hope you enjoy! <br><br>
First, I basically just used images and gifs (for animation) in my html, everything else was handled with some css and javascript classes. (A premature advice, using gifs as animations that won't stop will save you a lot of time).<br><br>
There isn't much new in my css file, just the sky animation that was done manually with two images and two separate keyframes. I lowered the opacity of the two so that the intersection between the images would not be visible (USE GIFS, this opacity solution took longer than it should).<br><br>
I will explain each of my js functions:<br><br>
The jump function, just insert a css class, which calls a jump animation (bottom: 130px)<br><br>
A function to check every 10m if the player has died (In case the distance from the obstacle collides with the player and he has not jumped)<br><br>
This function changes the player's image if it dies <br><br>
And finally the most basic, which defines any key to jump.<br><br>
In the future I would like to implement a score and a death popup. Everything will be documented here and also on my blog:
